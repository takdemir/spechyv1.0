
A HOSTING COMPANY SHOPPING PROCESS

1-  Project's main purpose is marketing the hostings, servers and domains
2-  When we open the web site, we will see the categories on the left side of the web site as left menu. When we click the categories names,
    the services of the categories will be seen by the customers and when the services names are clicked, products of that services will be seen.
3-  When the customer started to shopping, he/she will choose the product from the left side. Customer will see the details of the product on the page which is opend after clicked,
    and after he decided to add to his/her cart, he will click the "Buy the product" button and the shopping process will be started. After the shopping has finished, system will look at the
    time and if time is greater than 07 AM and less than 15 PM, system will give information to customer that
    his product will be shipped/approved on current day else if time is greater than 15 PM and less than midnight than system will give information to customer
    that his product will be shipped/approved on tomorrow else he/she will be informed that his package will be shipped/approved on the working hours of the current day.

4- I didn't do the createNewOrder function because you did not want me to do but, after that shopping process is ended, we will register customer's orders to the orders/customer_orders table on the database.
